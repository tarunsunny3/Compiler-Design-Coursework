# Compiler-Design

1. Remove all comments from a C/C++ program file.
2. Write a program that will keep track of all names used in a C program by listing the line numbers where a name is defined/declared and the line numbers where that name is used
3. Write a program for macro expansion with provision for argument substitution (#define in full generality)
4. Remove all left recursions from a given CFG.
5. Given a left factored CFG without left recursion, construct the predictive parsing table and check whether a string can be accepted or not using the predictive parsing algorithm
6. Given an operator precedence grammar, construct the operator precedence table and check whether a string can be accepted or not using the operator precedence parsing algorithm
7. Given a CFG, construct the SLR parsing table and check whether a string can be accepted or not using the LR parsing algorithm
